Anti-Overfitting Techniques
To prevent overfitting, the model implements several regularization techniques:

Tree Depth Limitation (max_depth=8):

Prevents trees from becoming too complex

Limits ability to memorize noise

Split Requirements (min_samples_split=10):

Requires minimum 10 samples to split a node

Prevents creating over-specific decision rules

Leaf Size Control (min_samples_leaf=5):

Ensures leaves have minimum 5 samples

Creates more generalized decision boundaries

Feature Subsampling (max_features='sqrt'):

Uses √n features per split (√5 ≈ 2 features)

Decorrelates trees in the forest

Improves ensemble diversity

Class Weight Balancing (class_weight='balanced'):

Adjusts weights for imbalanced failure data

Prevents bias toward majority class

Optimal Tree Selection:

Selects model with best validation F1 score

Balances precision and recall

Prevents using unnecessarily complex models

Interpreting Results
1. Accuracy/Loss Plot (train_val_metrics.png)
Blue solid line: Training accuracy

Green solid line: Validation accuracy

Blue dashed line: Training loss (1 - accuracy)

Green dashed line: Validation loss

Ideal behavior: Validation accuracy should closely follow training accuracy with minimal divergence

Overfitting indicator: Large gap between training and validation accuracy

2. Precision/Recall/F1 Plot (val_metrics_vs_trees.png)
Red line: Precision (accuracy of positive predictions)

Blue line: Recall (coverage of actual positives)

Green line: F1 Score (harmonic mean of precision/recall)

Vertical dashed line: Optimal tree count selected

Interpretation:

High precision: Few false alarms

High recall: Few missed failures

F1 balances both metrics

3. Confusion Matrices
Top-left: True negatives (correct non-failure predictions)

Top-right: False positives (false alarms)

Bottom-left: False negatives (missed failures)

Bottom-right: True positives (correct failure predictions)

4. Feature Importance
Shows relative importance of each SMART attribute

Higher bars indicate more predictive features

Helps identify which drive metrics are most indicative of failure

Conclusion
This implementation provides a robust framework for predicting hard drive failures using SMART attributes. The regularization techniques ensure the model generalizes well to new data, while the comprehensive visualizations offer insights into model performance and feature importance. The final model selection based on F1 score ensures a balance between precision (avoiding false alarms) and recall (catching actual failures).
